In this project, we will explore how to develop a simple Deep Neural Network for a classification problem. We will explore two common libraries: TensorFlow and Keras.
Then we will explore how to face a well known problem that is common to encounter during the training phase: the Overfitting.
Finally, we will study how to perform a fair model selection.
