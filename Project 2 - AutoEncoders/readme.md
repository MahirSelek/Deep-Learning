**Project : Develop Autoencoders**
---



In this project, we will deal with _dimensionality reduction_ and learn how to develop a simple _Autoencoder_.
In the first part, we will learn how to develop a simple shallow autoencoder, then we will develop a deep version. Next, we will experiment with the application of autoencoder on denoising data task (denoising-autoencoder). Finally, we will apply this model to sequential domains, considering the IMDB dataset seen in Recurrent Neural Networks & Transformer project.
